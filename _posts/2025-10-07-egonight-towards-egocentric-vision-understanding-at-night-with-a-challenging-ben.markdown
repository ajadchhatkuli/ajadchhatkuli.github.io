We present EgoNight, the first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime
egocentric vision, with visual question answering (VQA) as the core task.

A key feature of EgoNight is the introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night
annotation quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between lighting
conditions.
