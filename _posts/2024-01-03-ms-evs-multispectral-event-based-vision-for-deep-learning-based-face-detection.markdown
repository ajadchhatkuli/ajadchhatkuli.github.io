Event-based sensing is a relatively new imaging modality that enables low latency, low power, high
temporal resolution and high dynamic range acquisition.

These properties make it a highly desirable sensor for edge applications and in high dynamic range
environments.

As of today, most event-based sensors are monochromatic (grayscale), capturing light from a wide
spectral range over the visible, in a single channel.

In this paper, we introduce multispectral events and study their advantages.

In particular, we consider multiple bands in the visible and near-infrared range, and explore their
potential compared to monochromatic events and conventional multispectral imaging for the face
detection task.

We further release the first large scale bimodal face detection datasets, with RGB videos and their
simulated color events, N-MobiFace and N-YoutubeFaces, and a smaller dataset with multispectral
videos and events, N-SpectralFace.
