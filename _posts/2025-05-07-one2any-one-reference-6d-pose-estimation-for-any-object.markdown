We propose a novel method One2Any that estimates the relative 6-degrees of freedom
(DOF) object pose using only a single reference-single query RGB-D image, without prior knowledge of
its 3D model, multi-view data, or category constraints.

We treat object pose estimation as an encoding-decoding process: first, we obtain a comprehensive
Reference Object Pose Embedding (ROPE) that encodes an objectâ€™s shape, orientation, and texture from
a single reference view.

Using this embedding, a U-Net-based pose decoding module produces Reference Object Coordinate (ROC)
for new views, enabling fast and accurate pose estimation.

This simple encoding-decoding framework allows our model to be trained on any pair-wise pose data,
enabling large-scale training and demonstrating great scalability.
