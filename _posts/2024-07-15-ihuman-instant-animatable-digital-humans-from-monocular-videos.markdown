Personalized 3D avatars require an animatable representation of digital humans.

Doing so instantly from monocular videos offers scalability to broad class of users and wide-scale
applications.

In this paper, we present a fast, simple, yet effective method for creating animatable 3D digital
humans from monocular videos.

Our method utilizes the efficiency of Gaussian splatting to model both 3D geometry and appearance.

However, we observed that naively optimizing Gaussian splats results in inaccurate geometry, thereby
leading to poor animations.

This work achieves and illustrates the need of accurate 3D mesh-type modelling of the human body for
animatable digitization through Gaussian splats.
